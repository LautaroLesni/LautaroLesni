## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Full Stack Developer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina but moving soon to New Zealand, with professional experience building scalable web platforms and backend systems for government and enterprise-level projects.

I specialize in designing clean architectures, building modular APIs, optimizing relational databases, and creating maintainable front-end applications using React and Angular.

I enjoy building systems the right way — structured, scalable, and performance-oriented — not just shipping features.

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- Designing REST APIs with clean service/repository separation
- PostgreSQL schema design & complex query optimization
- Backend development with Node.js (NestJS), .NET, and Java (Spring Boot)
- Scalable frontend applications with React + TypeScript
- State management architecture (Context API, modular patterns)
- AI-assisted development with responsible review and refinement
- Writing maintainable, production-ready code

## 🏗 Professional Experience

Currently working at **Phinx Lab**, developing full-stack solutions for government platforms focused on course inscription and administrative systems.

Key responsibilities:
- Designing backend services and database schemas
- Implementing complex business logic and validation flows
- Writing optimized SQL queries for reporting and data analysis
- Building responsive user interfaces with React and Angular
- Collaborating in multidisciplinary agile teams

## 🤖 AI & Engineering

I actively use AI tools to:
- Accelerate boilerplate generation
- Review and refine architecture decisions
- Optimize queries and logic
- Improve documentation clarity

But I always validate, test edge cases, and refine outputs before production use.

Engineering judgment comes first.
